E-Learning Platform API

A production-ready RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, and MySQL for managing a full-featured e-learning platform. The system enables instructors to create and manage courses, lessons, quizzes, and assessments, while students can enroll in courses, track progress, participate in discussions, and earn badges through gamification.

The API follows a modular, scalable architecture with robust authentication, authorization, validation, testing, and documentation.
